## AI thoughts / Ideas / Self Research Directions:

#### -> It is important to be able to differentiate between which problems just require more data and compute to work and which problems needs core algorithmic inventions
#### -> Creating models which need less labeled training data use - one shot learning, learning from unstructured data, weak labels
#### -> Something about GANs: use them as feature extractor in an unsupervised task to learn about data distribution and then maybe see the results you get with these learned features in a supervised setting
#### -> Estimating Uncertainity in Registration Errors would be a nice direction!
#### -> Need Faster Training ? Binarized Neural Networks might be interesting (7 times faster than conventional CNNs)
#### -> Future of DL: Contrastive Learning wherein we try to find vector representations of missing regions instead of predicting exact pixel values and Transformers that can be combined with CNNs because of their capability to learn without the need for labeled data
