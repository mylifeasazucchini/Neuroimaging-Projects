## AI thoughts / Ideas / Self Research Directions:

#### -> What kind of results do we obtain if you converted Non-Image like data into Images and used CNN ?
#### -> It is important to be able to differentiate between which problems just require more data and compute to work and which problems needs core algorithmic inventions
#### -> Creating models which need less labeled training data use - one shot learning, learning from unstructured data, weak labels
#### -> Something about GANs, use them as feature extractor in an unsupervised task to learn about data distribution and then maybe see the results you get with these learned features in a supervised setting


## Next Projects Ideas
